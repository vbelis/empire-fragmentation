# Empire fragmentation

## Description
Investigating the phenomenon of empire fragmentation on a grid using agent based modelling. The goal of this project is to investigate the conditions under which an empire is overthrown due to a revolution. For more details, definitions, and the exact model description please check the report in `docs/empire_fragmentation_report.pdf`. 

## How to install
The easiest way play around with the simulations produced by the code is to install all dependencies within an anaconda environment, running on a linux device. After cloning the repository locally, you would need to run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
using the `environment.yml` file provided in the repo.
